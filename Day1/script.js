const tryingAssignment = 42
console.log(tryingAssignment);

console.log(tryingAssignment); // const is never made for reassignment 

// Use let by default for block-scoped variables
// Use const for values that won't be reassigned
// Avoid var in modern JavaScript unless you specifically need function scoping
// let helps prevent common bugs related to scope and hoisting

// The introduction of let (and const) in ES6 solved many of the confusing behaviors associated with var and made JavaScript code more predictable and easier to debug.
